# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

# Each fixture has a purpose (regular user)

  first_name: Chris
  last_name: Oliver
  email: chris@gorails.com
  encrypted_password: <%= Devise::Encryptor.digest(User, 'password') %>
